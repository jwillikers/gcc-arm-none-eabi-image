A container image for running the {GNU-Arm-Embedded-Toolchain} for C and {cpp}, built on {Fedora}.
Comes complete with Black, CMake, Conan, Ninja, and Clang tools.

== Synopsis

Image:: https://quay.io/repository/jwillikers/gnu-arm-embedded[quay.io/jwillikers/gnu-arm-embedded]

Tags::
* `latest`

Supported architectures::
* `amd64` _(x86_64)_
* `arm` _(armhfp)_
* `arm64` _(aarch64)_

User:: The default user inside the container is named `user`.

Working directory:: By default, the working directory is the default user's home directory: `/home/user`.

Labels::
`io.containers.autoupdate=registry`::: Enables automatic updates when using Podman and the _fully-qualified_ image name.

== Quick Start

First, ensure your user is in the `dialout` group allowing access to serial devices.

[source,sh]
----
sudo usermod -aG $USER dialout
----

NOTE: You'll have to log out and back in for the changes to take effect

Use the following command to run the container via {Podman} and access the GNU Arm Embedded Toolchain.
The example enters the container, mounting the current working directory, Conan's configuration directory, and Git's configuration directory.
Additionally, it mounts the serial device `/dev/ttyBmpGdb`, the hosted GDB server on a {Black-Magic-Probe} which allows flashing firmware to a target board.

[source,sh]
----
podman run \
    --rm \
    --userns keep-id \
    --group-add keep-groups \
    --device /dev/ttyBmpGdb:/dev/ttyBmpGdb \
    --security-opt label=disable \
    --volume "$PWD":/home/user \
    --volume "$HOME/.conan":/home/user/.conan \
    --volume "$HOME/.config/git":/home/user/.git/config \
    --name gnu-arm-embedded \
    -it \

== Build

This project uses {Buildah} and {Podman} for building and testing the image.
A set of {pre-commit} checks are readily available to ensure your code is up-to-spec at the time it is committed.
Instructions for setting up a development environment, building the image, and testing the image follow.
These instructions are intended for users of {Fedora-Silverblue}, where the packages `buildah`, `git`, and `podman` are already available.
Moreover, I use the {fish} shell.

. Install the {fish} shell.
+
[source,sh]
----
sudo rpm-ostree install fish
----

. Reboot to finish the installation.
+
[source,sh]
----
systemctl reboot
----

. Clone this repository.
+
[source,sh]
----
git -C ~/Projects clone git@github.com:jwillikers/gnu-arm-embedded-image.git
----

. Install {pre-commit}.
+
[source,sh]
----
pip install pre-commit
----

. Change into the project directory.
+
[source,sh]
----
cd ~/Projects/gnu-arm-embedded-image
----

. Install pre-commit's Git hooks.
+
[source,sh]
----
pre-commit install
----

. Run the `build.fish` shell script using `buildah unshare` to create the image.
+
[source,sh]
----
buildah unshare ~/Projects/gnu-arm-embedded-image/build.fish
----

. Verify the image with works correctly by running the `test.fish` shell script.
+
[source,sh]
----
~/Projects/gnu-arm-embedded-image/test.fish
